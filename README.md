# SaaS Acquisition & Conversion Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines customer acquisition funnel performance across marketing channels, user platforms, and geographic markets for a fictional SaaS company using synthetic AI-generated data.

**Key Findings:**
- **Paid Search** shows the highest conversion quality (53% visitor-to-demo) but limited scale
- **Organic Search** drives the most traffic (252 visitors) but underconverts to purchases (27%)
- **Mobile devices** represent 34% of traffic but only 8% of purchases—a critical leakage point
- **Germany & UK** are mature, high-performing markets; **Poland & Belgium** punch above their weight
- Sales cycle is consistent at 7-8 days across all segments

---

## Business Problem

1. Marketing efficiency vs. scale trade-off: High-converting channels have low volume; high-traffic channels underconvert
2. Platform mismatch: Mobile represents substantial traffic but fails to convert to purchases
3. Geographic inconsistency: Major European markets (France, Spain) dramatically underperform relative to traffic
4. Lack of actionable priority: Unclear which segments deserve increased investment

## Methodology

- **Data:** Synthetic dataset representing a B2B SaaS company across 5 channels, 5 platforms, 11 countries
- **Metrics:** Conversion rates at each funnel stage (visitors → sign-ups → demos → purchases)
- **Approach:** Comparative performance analysis, conversion rate benchmarking, funnel velocity assessment

## Recommendations (Prioritized)

### Immediate (0-3 Months)

1. **Fix Mobile Funnel** – Mobile devices show strong early engagement (0.43-0.51 demo rate) but collapse at purchase (0.25-0.28). Conduct UX audit and A/B testing to identify and eliminate conversion barriers.

2. **Increase Paid Search Budget** – This channel delivers the highest-quality leads (53% demo conversion). Scale budget allocation by 100-150% to increase volume without sacrificing conversion efficiency.

3. **Diagnose France & Spain Underperformance** – These markets show 40-50% lower conversion than Germany/UK despite similar traffic. Conduct diagnostic research to determine if this reflects product-market fit, pricing, localization, or sales execution issues.

### Secondary (3-6 Months)

4. **Optimize Organic Search Closing** – Organic Search drives the most traffic (252 visitors) but has the lowest purchase conversion (27%). Issue likely isn't visitor quality but post-demo sales execution. Improve sales follow-up or product trial experience.

5. **Test Poland & Belgium Scaling** – Both markets show 2-3x higher conversion efficiency than secondary markets. Test increased investment to validate if performance scales with higher traffic volume.

6. **Accelerate Email Closing** – Email has strong demo conversion (49%) but longer sales cycle (2.08 days vs. 1.94 average). Implement automated nurture sequences and dedicated sales resources for email-sourced leads.

### Long-Term (6+ Months)

7. **Clarify Mobile Strategy** – Decide if mobile is strategic or secondary. If strategic, invest in mobile UX redesign; if secondary, reduce mobile marketing spend and reallocate to Paid Search and Email.

8. **Implement Tiered Geographic Growth** – Maintain Germany/UK baseline, accelerate Poland/Belgium investment, hold France/Spain pending diagnostics, deprioritize low-volume markets.

9. **Build Cohort Analytics** – Implement customer cohort tracking by channel to measure lifetime value and CAC payback period—essential for future capital allocation decisions.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data analysis and funnel optimization
- Comparative performance benchmarking
- Business problem diagnosis
- Strategic priority setting
- Clear communication of complex findings

---

## Data Limitations

- Synthetic, AI-generated data (not reflective of real customer behavior)
- Single time period snapshot (no trend analysis)
- Last-click attribution model (doesn't account for multi-touch journeys)
- Small sample sizes in some segments (Czech Republic, Austria)

---

## Conclusion

The company has a solid foundation with consistent sales cycles and proven performance in core markets (Germany, UK, Windows/macOS). However, three urgent priorities exist: (1) fix the mobile funnel collapse, (2) investigate geographic underperformance in major markets, and (3) capitalize on high-efficiency channels. Addressing these within 6 months can unlock significant growth.
